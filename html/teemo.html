    <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/teemo/" target="_blank" title="League of Legends">Teemo</a> scouts the world with boundless enthusiasm and a cheerful spirit.<br>
    A yordle with an unwavering sense of morality, he takes pride in following the Bandle Scout's Code, sometimes with such eagerness that he is unaware of the broader consequences of 
    his actions.<br>
    Though some say the existence of the Scouts is questionable, one thing is for certain: Teemo's conviction is nothing to be trifled with.<br></p>

    GUERRILLA WARFARE<br>
    If Teemo stands still and takes no actions for a short duration, he becomes Invisible indefinitely.<br>
    If he's in brush, Teemo can enter and maintain his Invisibility while moving.<br>
    After leaving Invisibility, Teemo gains the Element of Surprise, increasing his Attack Speed for a few seconds.<br></p>
