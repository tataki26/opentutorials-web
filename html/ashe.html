    <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/teemo/" target="_blank" title="League of Legends">Ashe</a> commands the most populous horde in the north.<br>
    Stoic, intelligent, and idealistic, yet uncomfortable with her role as leader, she taps into the ancestral magics of her lineage to wield a bow of True Ice.<br>
    With her people's belief that she is the mythological hero Avarosa reincarnated, Ashe hopes to unify the Freljord once more by retaking their ancient, tribal lands.<br></p>

    FROST SHOT<br>
    Ashe's attacks slow their target, causing her to deal increased damage to these targets.<br>
    Ashe's critical strikes deal no bonus damage but apply an empowered slow to the target.<br></p>
